			Installation Instructions<br>
				</font></b><br>
			<b><font size="+1">Installing and Uninstalling Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5 for Windows</font></b><br>
			<br>To install Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5, follow these steps:<br>
			<br>- Make sure you have at least 120 MB of available disk space for a Typical installation of Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5.<br>
			
			
			
			- Make sure you have turned off all anti-virus software before beginning the installation.<br>- Install Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5.<br>
			<br>To uninstall Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5, follow these steps:<br>
			
			- From Start select Settings, Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs<br>- Select Adobe Acrobat 5 and press the Add/Remove... button<br>
			<br>Note: Uninstalling Adobe Acrobat 5.0.5 also uninstalls Acrobat 5.0, Acrobat Reader 5.x, Acrobat 4.x, and Acrobat 3.x if present on your system because they share common files.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Adobe SVG Viewer 2.0<br>
			</b><br>Adobe Acrobat 5.x and Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.x install Adobe SVG Viewer 2.0. To learn more about Adobe SVG Viewer 2.0 use your browser to open the ReadMe.html file located within your browser's plugins folder.<br>
			<br>
			<b>PostScript&reg; Driver<br>
			</b><br>Installing Acrobat 5.0.5 upgrades your PostScript driver; the specific driver and version installed depends upon your computer's operating system. Acrobat 5.0.5 installs:<br>-AdobePS&#153; 4.5.1 for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME.<br>-AdobePS&#153; 5.2 for Windows NT 4<br>
			-Pscript5.2 for Windows 2000<br>
			<br>
			For last minute updates on the PostScript driver please see the Readme.wri file located in the Utilities\Drivers\WinInstaller 1.0.4\Adobe directory on your product CD. If you want to install the PostScript driver for Windows 2000, please be sure to use the Acrobat Installer's Custom Install option for PostScript driver installation; do not use the WinInstaller 1.0.4 located in the Utilities\Drivers\WinInstaller 1.0.4 folder.<br>
			<br>
			Migrating an existing Windows 98, 98SE, ME, or 2000 operating system to Windows XP deletes the Acrobat Distiller Printer and PDFWriter. To correct this problem, reinstall the Distiller Printer and PDF Writer by using the Custom Install options Acrobat Distiller Files and Acrobat PDFWriter Files.[448122]<br>
			<br>
			<b>
			Installation Issues</b><br>
			<br>
			Make sure you have turned off all anti-virus software before beginning the installation. Device drivers may also conflict with Acrobat's installer. Starting Windows 95, 98, ME, or Windows 2000 in Safe Mode, or starting Windows NT in VGA mode, causes Windows to load only essential standard device drivers. Note: If you boot your system in Safe Mode, your CD-ROM will be disabled. Copy the Acrobat5 folder to your hard disk drive first. Then, install Acrobat 5.x from your hard disk.You will need approximately 100MB of free disk space to copy the Acrobat5 folder to your hard disk.<br>
			<br>
			If the Adobe Acrobat 5.x installer or uninstaller fails to work properly, manually delete the file Uninst.isu from Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Acrobat 5\98 or NT then reinstall Adobe Acrobat 5.x and uninstall.<br>
			<br>If the Adobe Acrobat 5.x installer fails to complete an installation due to a lack of disk space, and you have changed the Typical installation using the Custom installation screens, the installer may be calculating the available disk space incorrectly. Quit the installer and manually check the amount of available disk space in the Windows Explorer to verify that you have adequate disk space to install the portions of Acrobat you have selected.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Installing Asian Language Files for Acrobat 5.x or Acrobat Reader 5.x<br>
			</b><br>Asian Language Files are available for Acrobat 5.x and Acrobat Reader 5.x. With any language version of Acrobat 5.x or Acrobat Reader 5.x, you can display Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files that contain text in Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). If the author of a PDF file embeds CJK fonts in the document, then any language version of Acrobat 5.x will be able to display the CJK text on any system without additional software. If the author uses CJK fonts but does not embed them in the document, then you will need access to the correct Asian fonts in order to view the PDF file on non-native systems. Note that for Acrobat Reader 5.x you need the additional Asian fonts installed in order to view the PDF file on non-native systems even if the author of a PDF file embeds CJK fonts in the document. All you need to do is install the appropriate Asian font pack for use with Acrobat . Asian Language Support is a Custom Install option available in the Acrobat 5.x installer. In addition, the Asian Language Support installers are available on the Adobe Acrobat 5.x product CD, or from Adobe's web site at: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/cjkfontpack.html">http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html</a><br>

			<b>You must have administrative privileges to install Acrobat on Windows XP<br>
			</b>If you are installing Acrobat on Windows XP and see this message: &quot;Setup has detected that unInstallShield is in use. Please close unInstallShield and restart setup&quot;, this indicates that you may not have administrative privileges. You must have administrative privileges to install Acrobat on Windows XP.[463525]<br>
			<br>
			<b>PPKEF is not available for Windows XP<br>
				</b>
				The PPKEF signature handler is not available for Windows XP.[442039]
<br>
			<br>
				<b>Using the Palm SelfSign.prc application to create a signature on a Palm organizer</b>
			<br>
				If you have a Palm organizer, you can use your Palm to create a signature for use in Acrobat 5. To do this follow these steps:<br>
			-From your Windows or Macintosh system from the Palm Desktop software select the Install Tool (Instapp.exe) in the organizer's Install folder and use the browser that appears to locate the SelfSign.prc application in your Acrobat PalmPilot folder. Choose the appropriate user name form the drop-down list.<br>
			
				-HotSync the organizer to load the SelfSign application (SelfSign.prc) onto the Palm organizer.<br>
				-Start the organizer, press the Applications icon, and press the SelfSign icon in the applications panel.
			<br>
			-Write your signature in the two boxes that appear in the display area of the organizer. Using the organizer's stylus, write directly in the boxes rather than in the Graffiti area that you normally write in. You can begin writing in either box and, if necessary, continue in the other box. Continue writing from one box to the other until you have added all the text you need. In the signature appearance, the segments of text from the boxes will be pieced together left to right to look like continuous text. A line at the top of the display shows show your final text will appear. If you want space (such as a word space) in front of a continuing segment of text, leave the space at the left edge of the segment's box. Begin writing the segment at the beginning of the left edge if you do not want any space in front of it.<br>
			-Clicking the Clear button deletes the most recently added segment. You can click Clear repreatedly to delete as many segments as you want, one at a time. <br>
			-Click Done.<br>
			-HotSync the organizer to copy the picture file to your hard drive.<br>
			-Complete the process by following the instructions on page 199 of Acrobat Help.[443463]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Duplicated Form field check boxes act like radio buttons</b>
			<br>
			
			
				When creating a form, if you duplicate a check box, the duplicated check boxes act like radio buttons, that is, when you turn one on, the other checkboxes are turned off.To prevent this, create check boxes individually and do not duplicate them.[443951]<br>
			<br>
				<b>Searching is not supported for certain characters</b>
			<br>
			Adobe Acrobat Catalog does not support the indexing of WinAnsi characters 0127 through 0158. This set of characters includes symbols such as currency symbols (for example, dollar sign, Euro, Yen). Adobe Acrobat Catalog also does not support the indexing of documents formattedwith ligatures enabled, lower case numerals, or with small caps. Since these characters can not be indexed, you cannot use Search to find occurences of them in a PDF file.[443269,418016]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing collated copies does not work on Windows 2000.</b><b>[415358, 418016]<br>
				<br>
				
				Using the right click command to print uses the PostScript Language Level setting of the previous print job on Windows NT and Windows 2000</b><br>
			If you open a document in Acrobat and print it to a PostScript Language Level 3 printer the language level used by Acrobat will be set to PostScript Language Level 3 by default. If you exit Acrobat and change the default printer to be a PostScript Level 2 printer and then right-click on a PDF file to request printing, the print job will abort because the PostScript Language Level is set to Level 3 not Level 2. To prevent this, after changing the default printer, open and print a document in Acrobat before using the right-click command to print.[416598, 418016]<br>
			<br>
				<b>Turn off PowerPoint option &quot;Auto-fit text to text placeholder&quot; when using Convert to Adobe PDF</b>
			<br>On Windows 98 and ME, when you create a PDF from PowerPoint, the text of certain fonts may appear garbled or repeated in the PDF file. To prevent this from occurring, turn off the PowerPoint option &quot;Auto-fit text to text placeholder&quot; in PowerPoint's Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Edit tab before creating the PDF file.[443945]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Distiller Printer and PDFWriter are deleted when the operating system is migrated to Windows XP</b><br>Migrating an existing Windows 98, 98SE, ME, or 2000 operating system to Windows XP deletes the Acrobat Distiller Printer and PDFWriter. To correct this problem, reinstall the Distiller Printer and PDF Writer by using the Custom Install options Acrobat Distiller Files and Acrobat PDFWriter Files.[448122]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing to Distiller Printer u</b><b>sing Windows or Citrix Terminal Server</b><br>
				To print to Distiller Printer successfully from a client system, on the Windows or Citrix server, Distiller Printer
			<br>
				 must be running in an Administrator session. If Distiller Printer is not running in an Administrator session, the application may hang with the error message: &quot;There was an error found when printing the document to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.Winnt\Desktop\*PDF&quot;.[451824]
<br>
			<br>
			<b>Use fdf to import a trusted certificate</b><br>
			In describing the process of importing a Trusted Certificate, the Acrobat Help sub-section &quot;To import a certificate from a key file:&quot; (page 207) should list the file extension .fdf as an option instead of .apf. Acrobat does not allow .apf files to be imported and displays an error message.[452853]<br>
			<br>
			<b>JavaScript Updates in Acrobat 5.0.5</b>
			<br>-A new boolean property, &quot;disclosed&quot; is available for the Doc object, and its default value is &quot;false&quot;,<br>-Even if the API call app.openDoc is successful opening the requested document, it returns value &quot;false&quot; to the caller unless the opened document sets Doc.disclosed to &quot;true&quot; as part of a Doc-level script. If Doc.disclosed is &quot;true&quot;, Doc.openDoc returns the Doc Object of the document opened by this method,<br>-app.activeDocs only includes in the returned array the Doc Object for each active document open in the Viewer that has set Doc.disclosed to &quot;true&quot; at the time of app.activeDocs invocation.[463695]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Using Online Comments with Oracle8i client software</b>
<br>
			
				Problems may be encountered with Oracle 8i client version 8.1.7 when using Online Comments with an Oracle comment repository. Oracle 8i client version 8.1.5 is recommended instead.[463774]<br>

			<br>
			<b>Using Acrobat 4.x or Acrobat Reader 4.x to view and print files created in Acrobat 5.x</b><br>You can use Acrobat 4.x or Acrobat Reader 4.x to view and print PDF files created with Acrobat 5.x, taking note of the following:<br>
			-PDF files with 128-bit encryption will not open in Acrobat 4.x,<br>-Transparency is not supported in Acrobat 4.0; PDF files containing such graphics can only be fully appreciated in Acrobat 5.x,<br>
			-Scanned PDF files which use JBIG2 compression will not open in Acrobat 4.x,<br>-Acrobat 5 enables any font on your system to be used in a Free Text annotation. However, Acrobat 4.x allowed only the base PostScript Roman fonts and the Heisei Japanese fonts. If a Japanese Free Text annotation is created in Acrobat 5.x using fonts other than the Japanese Heisei fonts, this text annotation will not be displayed correctly on Acrobat 4.x, [397619]<br>-PDF files that contain new JavaScript operators may issue errors to the JavaScript console if run in Acrobat 4.0. Please see the section on Document Conventions/Quick Bars in the Acrobat JavaScript Object Specification for authoring guidelines to prevent this type of error.<br>-PDF files whose fonts use new predefined CMaps may not open properly in Acrobat 4.0<br>-Some forms created in Acrobat 5.x may generate FDF data that cannot be parsed correctly by server-side CGI scripts written with the Acrobat 4.0 FDF Toolkit<br>-Acrobat Form fields in Acrobat 4.x supported only a limited number of fonts. While the forms tool in Acrobat 5.x enables you to specify any font which allows editing and embedding in a form field, users cannot fill in such forms in Acrobat 4.x. Please consider this when designing forms that may be viewed with Acrobat 4.x.[397754, 312623, 410665]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Acrobat 5.x and Acrobat 4.x handle some base fonts differently than Acrobat 3.0<font size="+1"><br>
				</font></b>Acrobat 5.x and Acrobat 4.x handle fonts differently than version 3.0. These changes do not affect most users, however if you want more information on this subject, go to the Adobe support database at<br>
				<a href="http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/custsupport/main.html</a> and search for document #322792.
				
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Using the Toolbar<font size="+1"><br>
				</font></b>Acrobat's toolbars can be torn-off, docked on the top, and their geometry may be changed. Torn-off toolbars cannot be combined by dragging the title bar of the toolbar; use the drag handle of the toolbar instead.[398112]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Viewing PDF files within Internet Explorer and Netscape</b>
			<br>
			When attempting to view relatively large PDF files, you may see an error message saying &quot;Page processing error. File input/output error. Time out during connecting.&quot; Other symptoms that you may see are Acrobat displays blank pages or Acrobat may hang. Check with your systems or network administrator that the version of Apache being used is 1.3.17 or greater. Acrobat may exhibit the symptoms listed above with earlier versions of Apache.[417553]	<br>
			<br>
			<b>Adobe Online, Web Capture, and Online Registration special firewall considerations</b><br>Acrobat usually cannot connect directly to the Internet through a firewall, which is a software and hardware barrier protecting computers on a network from being accessed by computers outside the network. Acrobat can connect to the Internet through a firewall, though, if you configure your computer's Internet proxy settings to allow it. Contact your network or web administrator for the proxy settings you need to use. After you specify proxy settings, the online utilities should function properly.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How to make sure the Euro character will always appear in a PDF</b><br>
			If a PDF uses the Euro character but does not embed the font that includes this character, and this PDF is viewed on a system that has an older version of the font installed where the Euro character is missing, the PDF will be missing all occurrences of the Euro character. To prevent this problem from occurring, when you create a PDF that requires the Euro character, be sure to embed the font. If you are viewing a PDF with missing Euro characters, consider updating the fonts on your system to a newer version that contains the Euro character.[288428]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Links in PDF documents should follow proper cross-platform conventions</b><br>
			To reliably create cross document links that work when a PDF travels to a Windows, Macintosh or UNIX machine, make sure your PDF links only to files with names that follow the ISO 9660 convention. This includes the need for file names to be uppercase, 8.3 format, and use a limited character set (no slashes, spaces, and high ASCII characters).[288966]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Guidelines for creating worldwide PDFs using the Number Pages feature</b><br>
			When using Acrobat's Document &gt; Number Pages feature to apply special page numbering schemes to a document, first consider the destination of your PDF. If you are creating a PDF in an Asian language version of Acrobat and expect the PDF to be read by others who are running Roman language versions of Acrobat, on the Page Numbering dialog only enter Prefixes using Roman language characters. Asian characters may not view and edit properly on Roman systems.[278010]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Changing monitor color settings may affect Acrobat</b><br>
			If you change the number of colors your monitor displays while Acrobat is running, restart Acrobat to be certain your PDF files will display with the correct colors.[288721]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Tips for moving pages within a document that uses multiple page numbering methods</b><br>
			When a PDF document contains multiple page numbering methods, if you move a page between sections using differing methods, the page number will not be updated. To fix this, select Document &gt; Number Pages and renumber the entire document using one page numbering method, then create new sections with differing methods.[277533]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Viewing and printing PDF files containing fonts that Acrobat does not directly support.</b><br>
			If you create PDF files containing Roman fonts that Acrobat does not directly support or with Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, Cyrillic, and Eastern European fonts and you choose not to embed all fonts, Acrobat can display and print files on any system where these fonts are installed. If you create PDF files with Roman fonts that Acrobat does not directly support, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese,  or Korean and you choose not to embed all fonts, Acrobat can display and print files even if the fonts are not installed on the system, as long as the files are in a Roman font or you have installed Acrobat's Asian Language Font Pack. If you create PDF files containing fonts in languages other than those mentioned above, Acrobat needs the PDF files to have the fonts embedded in order to display or print them properly. We strongly recommend that for maximum document portability and fidelity that you embed all fonts.[291335]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Nvidia TNT graphics card with True (32-bit) color set</b><br>If you are using a Nvidia TNT graphics card and your display is set to use True (32-bit) color, you may experience a general protection fault crash in Module NVDISP.drv. The crash will occur if the Opacity setting in the Comments preferences is set to less than 100% and there are one or more Comment popup windows overlapping. You can avoid the problem by setting the Opacity in the Comments Preferences to 100% or by setting the display to 16-bit color (in the Display Control Panel). Please check the Nvidia web site for a driver update that may solve this problem. [419590]<br>

			<br>
			<b>Do not print to a PostScript file from Acrobat and distill it</b><br>
			Because of font encoding issues, we recommend that you do not print to a PostScript file from Acrobat and distill it. If you insist on doing so, make sure to select a directory for the output file that is different from the directory containing the original PDF. In the resulting PDF, Structure and Tagged PDF features will be lost and text may not be searchable.[291665]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Tips for printing PDF files to low memory printers</b><br>If you are printing a PDF file to non-PostScript printer with a small amount of RAM (for example, 2 MB), the printer may run out of memory. If this occurs, you have four options:<br>-In Acrobat's Print dialog, select Save Printer Memory<br>-In Acrobat's Print dialog, select Properties and change the print resolution to something lower, like 300 dpi.<br>-Upgrade the memory in the printer.<br>-Use the &quot;Print as image&quot; setting in Acrobat's Print dialog.[285296]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing multiple .doc files</b><br>
			If you will be printing multiple .doc files from Microsoft Word to a PDFPort in Distiller Printer you may need to set the Windows Spooler to be ON before being able to print successfully. See Adobe's Support Knowledgebase Document 324122 at: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/1da76.htm">http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/1da76.htm</a> for additional information.[417285]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Verify printer Properties after changing printers</b><br>
			If you switch from a monochrome LaserJet set at 600dpi to a color DeskJet printer, verify that the printer Properties are reset to 300dpi, which should be the default for color DeskJet printers. If needed, reset the dpi to an appropriate value.[291271]<br>
			<br>
			<b>How to make sure PDFs with custom page sizes print as expected</b><br>
			The default Acrobat printing behavior is to scale the PDF page to fit the paper size. If you do not want your PDF scaled to the current paper size, follow these steps. In Acrobat's print dialog, uncheck Fit To Page, then select Properties and choose the correct paper size.[286072]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing using Advanced Features</b><br>
			The Advanced print option &quot;Choose output tray by PDF page size&quot; may cause unexpected results. If your PDF document size does not match the paper size in the selected printer's paper tray, Print dialog features such as Shrink, Expand, and Auto-rotate will be ignored and some amount of clipping along the edges of the paper may be seen. [412148<br>
			<br>
			<b>Using the Print As Image option may eliminate printing problems</b><br>
			If Acrobat fails to print a file correctly, try selecting the Print As Image option in Acrobat's Print dialog. This option, which tells Acrobat to send a 300 dpi raster image to the printer rather than vector art, may enable troublesome files to print. This option is not, however, recommended for general purpose use because it may make many PDF files print slower.[289026]<br>
			<br>
			<b>For Windows 95, 98, ME and NT only: </b><b>How to make sure N-up printing works with a PostScript driver</b><br>
			If you have not done a Typical install of Acrobat, and you have not installed Acrobat Distiller, you may not have the AdobePS printer driver on your system. If you print from Acrobat using the Microsoft PSCRIPT PostScript printer driver, which is the likely scenario if you do not have the AdobePS driver installed, Acrobat's N-up printing option will not work. The N-up printing option, which allows you to print multiple pages on one page, is only available if you print from Acrobat using the AdobePS printer driver. AdobePS can be installed independently from the Acrobat CD-ROM, or in conjunction with Acrobat Distiller using the general Acrobat installer.[284943]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing Even/Odd pages and Reverse pages do not work together.</b> [296097]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Problems when printing or viewing complex or merged PDF files</b><br>
			Merging documents using insert pages may result in documents which may exceed the available memory in the printer because of possible font duplication. Possible workarounds include: <br>
			1) Use &quot;Print as image&quot;.<br>
			2) Documents to be merged should have font subsetting turned off.<br>3) Large documents should be created in one Distiller run as opposed to merging chapters. (Refer to &quot;Combining PostScript files&quot; page 41 in Acrobat Help.)<br>
			For FrameMaker users, use the create book feature when generating large documents instead of converting individual chapters to PDF and then merging chapters together.<br>

			<b>PDF pages printed on PCL printers may not be centered</b><br>
			Certain DeskJet and other non-PostScript printers have printer drivers that do not have consistent margins all the way around the page.  The left and right values generally are equivalent, but the top and bottom are sometimes quite different.  This can result in a PDF file, or another file type, being printed with the contents appearing to shift toward the top of the page. Try printing with the Fit To Page option turned on in the Print dialog to alleviate the effect. This may be useful, however there is no guaranteed fix since the issue is with the printer driver.[283825]<br>

			<b>Printing smooth shades to the HP4050N</b><br>
			Smooth shades may be clipped when you print to the HP4050N printer using HP's PCL 6 printer driver. You may want to try printing such files with HP's PCL 5e driver. [418321]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing issues using the HP LJ 6P Enhanced and Standard drivers on Win95<br>
			</b>Occasionally you may encounter PDF files which do not print correctly with the HP  LJ6P Enhanced and Standard printer drivers for Win95. If this occurs, try another HP printer driver for Win95 (LJ5 or LJ4), or use the Print As Image option in the Acrobat Print dialog.[288457]<br>
			<br>
			<b>PostScript Level 1 printing issues</b><br>
			Acrobat 4.0 PDFs which contain LAB based ICC images may not print correctly when printed to PostScript Level 1 printers. To assure proper printing of these high quality color PDFs, print them to a PostScript 3 or PostScript Level 2 printer.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing ImageType 4 files to Lexmark printers</b><br>
			Image Type 4 is a feature of PostScript 3. While application software creates ImageType 4 files somewhat infrequently, a PDF created from a GIF file with transparency using Acrobat WebCapture will contain ImageType 4.<br>
			When files containing ImageType 4 are printed to the Lexmark printers listed below, the printer may hang and no output is produced. The Lexmark printer models are: <br>
			-Lexmark Optra C710 PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS revision 2000411<br>
			-Lexmark Optra W810PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS revision 990917<br>
			<br>
			To work around this problem, you have two options: <br>
			1. Choose Print As Image from the Print dialog. This will produce results similar to what you see on the screen.<br>
			2. If your platform is Windows, you can change the Print Method from Language Level 3 to Language Level 2. Forcing the file to print at language level 2 enables Image Type 4 to print, but all transparency will be lost.[416539]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Some PostScript printing options have limited availability in Acrobat</b><br>Because of driver limitations, the PostScript printing options Print Mirror Image, Print Negative Image, Flip Horizontal or Vertical, and Invert Image are only available in Acrobat if you check the &quot;Print as Image&quot; option in the print dialog. Alternatively, if printing to an imagesetter you can print with &quot;Print as Image&quot; unchecked from Acrobat and have the image setter perform the mirror, flip and inversions.[283953]<br>
			<br>
			<b>What to do if stroked curves appear jagged when printed</b><br>
			If you observe jagged curves when printing a file to a PostScript printer, verify that the option to &quot;Use Printer Halftone Screens&quot; in the Acrobat Print dialog is checked.[291355]<br>

			When Acrobat finishes installing, it will ask whether you wish to restart your computer now or whether you will restart your computer later. When running with a screen reader, requesting to restart now may be ignored and you will remain in the installer. If this occurs,  you may request to restart later to exit the installer.  However, you should restart your computer before running Acrobat.[414601]<br>

			The Preference Panel for Comments includes an option to open pop-ups automatically on mouse over. When this option is selected and the mouse sits over a comment for several seconds,  the comment's note will be opened until the mouse moves off the comment. Comments that are opened via mouse over are not exposed to the screen reader, and the enabling of this preference is discouraged when using a screen reader. To read the note attached to a comment via a screen reader, move focus to the comment with Tab or Shift-Tab keyboard commands and open the comment with the Enter key.[379685]<br>

			<br>
			<b>Path names greater than 205 characters</b><br>
			Catalog will not index any file beneath a directory whose path is greater than 205 characters, since this results in file path names close to 256 characters. After completing the build, Catalog may claim to have found new files when in fact it did not add them to the index.[272841, 388981]<br>

			<br>
			<b>Windows 95/98 limits page size to 129 inches</b><br>Distiller 5.x supports the creation of PDF files with pages up to 200 inches by 200 inches in size. Due to a limitation with page size storage in Windows 95 and 98, the actual maximum page size will be limited to 129 inches by 129 inches. The maximum page size for Windows NT and for Mac OS is still 200 inches by 200 inches.[268654]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Auto Rotate Pages is turned off for Print/Press Job Options in Distiller</b><br>For eBook/Screen job options setting, Distiller will automatically rotate pages according to the dominant text orientation. This is done on a page by page basis and makes the files easier to read.

			<br>
			<b>Separation information is preserved in the Portable Job Ticket </b><br>
			
			Distiller does not support direct interpretation of printer systems-based separations (or In-RIP separations). When Distiller gets a PS file of this type, it will actually create a composite PDF file rather than a separated PDF file. The separation information will be preserved and passed into the PDF file through a Portable Job Ticket (PJTF). In the Advanced Panel of the Job Options, make sure &quot;Save Portable Job Ticket in PDF file&quot; is checked. The actual separation will only take place once the PDF file is passed to a printer or application that can take the information and apply the separations.[281244]<br>

			If you have an HP LaserJet 8500 installed, please do not set Distiller Printer to be your default printer. Due to a bug in the HP printer driver, doing so will cause a Windows error and you will need to re-install Acrobat. Distiller Printer will still function correctly if it is not the default printer.[403212]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Using Distiller Printer from Internet Explorer 4.x</b><br>
			
			To use &quot;Distiller Printer&quot; from IE 4.x you must enable the spooler from the &quot;Distiller Printer properties&quot; dialog.

			If you create a document in Microsoft Word on a Windows 2000 or Windows 98/ME system and set the page size to A4 using File-&gt;Page Setup, the PDF file will be created with a Letter Page size. This is due to a problem in Microsoft Word.[403616]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Custom page size converts to Letter in Windows 2000</b><br>
			If you create a document in Microsoft Word on a Windows 2000 system with a custom page size and then print it using the Distiller Printer, the PDF file will be created with a Letter Page size.[400417]<br>

			<b>Creating Acrobat Forms with appropriate Y2K date fields</b><br>
			
			The Acrobat Forms plug-in implements a &quot;date horizon&quot; when a field is specified with a date format that only uses two digits. If the year entered by the user is &lt; 50 then internally forms adds 2000 to the year. If the year entered by the user is &gt;= 50 then forms adds 1900 to the year. This horizon is implemented so that date calculations are correct and unambiguous.<br>
			
			Regardless of the internal representation, what the user has typed is sent to the server upon submit or export of form data. Server side software should be prepared to implement a similar date horizon if form fields have 2 digit year formats.<br>
			
			It is suggested, however, that authors specify a 4 digit year in a form field to prevent any perceived ambiguity. If the field is formatted with a 4 digit year then the user must enter all four digits or an error message will be generated.<br>

			<b>Submitting the incremental part of a signature (fdf) to the server fails</b><br>When the first signature gets signed in the Viewer (as opposed to the browser), regardless of whether you choose &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Save As&quot; from the Digital Signatures dialog, a full save takes place. If you immediately do a submit that is supposed to include append-saves, nothing will be sent, since there are no append-saves. The work-around is to provide a pre-signed document (e.g. Tools-&gt;Digital Signatures-&gt;Invisibly Sign Document). Not only is this a good idea in itself, so that people know they are working with legitimate documents, but it solves the above situation, since every signature after that is not the first one.

			<b>TouchUp Image Editing Problems and Photoshop</b><br>Photoshop 6.0 or later is required to fix certain TouchUp image editing problems. Versions of Adobe Photoshop prior to version 6.0 require a Photoshop plugin called PDFFormat in order to be able to help with the editing of PDF images when requested to do so by Adobe Acrobat TouchUp. This Photoshop plugin is installed by Acrobat 4.0, Acrobat 4.0.5, and also by Acrobat 5.x; Photoshop 6.0 does not need it. The version of PDFFormat installed by Acrobat 5.x is the same as that installed by Acrobat 4.0.5.<br>
			<br>
			There are some known problems with PDFFormat that have been corrected by functionality built in to Photoshop 6.0. These problems include:<br>
			- Image disappearing from PDF file in Acrobat when saved from Photoshop.<br>
			- Certain 1-bit-deep images are inverted when viewed in Photoshop.<br>
			- Scaling of certain images is handled incorrectly when returned to Acrobat from Photoshop.<br>
			<br>
			If you are using a version of Photoshop prior to Photoshop 6.0 and you encounter one of these problems, you may benefit from upgrading to Photoshop 6.0 or later.[401522, 401523, 402705, 402167]<br>

			<b>Copy &amp; paste limitations for CJK documents</b><br>
			Please be aware of the following limitations when selecting and copying CJK text from a PDF file and attempting to Paste it into another application:<br>
			<br>
			1. The name of the font will be different, unless PDF font name matches exactly the name of the font on the operating system. In general, PDF files that have been created by the Distiller will have font names that do not match font names on the OS. To workaround this problem, please select the text after it has been pasted, and change the font to that desired.<br>
			<br>2. Until Acrobat 4.05, Acrobat produced a bold effect of a font (&quot;synthetic bold&quot;) by writing text multiple times with overlapping in a PDF file. Copying and pasting such text will not produce the desired results. Acrobat 5.x fixes this problem and we recommend to re-create such PDF's to avoid copy and paste problems.[370717]<br>
			<br>3. Embedded Vertical TrueType text will have a line break in pasted text whenever an alphanumeric character appears. There is no workaround.[294989]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Japanese WebCapture on Roman system requires Conversion setting change</b><br>
			In order to capture Japanese web pages on a non-Japanese Windows system, you must (1) install Acrobat's Japanese language Font support (available under custom install, or as a separate installation), and (2) change the Japanese WebCapture input encoding setting to something other than &quot;None&quot; -- (to change setting, Open Web Page, click on Conversion Settings button, select HTML settings, and select the &quot;Japanese&quot; tab).[290326]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Proportional double-byte fonts must be embedded in PDF files</b><br>
			To ensure that PDF files that contain proportional double-byte fonts (available only on Windows) view and print correctly, the fonts must be embedded in the PDF.[286970]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Acrobat 5 support for the Hong Kong Supplemental Character Set</b><br>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government recently introduced the Hong Kong Supplemental Character Set (HKSCS). Acrobat 5 allows you to view and print PDF files containing HKSCS characters on all supported Windows operating systems supported by Acrobat 5.x (see the System Requirements section). If you would like to view PDF files that contain text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the Chinese Traditional Language Pack. When you use Distiller 5.x you can create PDF files containing HKSCS characters on Windows ME and Windows 2000 operating systems; other Windows operating systems are not supported. Before you can use Distiller 5.x to create such documents you need to install a kit available from the Hong Kong government's web site at: http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/hkscs/download.html [418559]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Hong Kong Character Set Not Part of Standard System Fonts</b><br>
			
			The Hong Kong character set is supported by Acrobat 5 for text in a PDF file. It is an extension to the Adobe Chinese Traditional character set. If you would like to create or view PDF files that contain text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the Chinese Traditional Language Pack. Since the Hong Kong character set is not part of the standard system fonts you will not be able to comment or create bookmarks using Hong Kong characters.[407877]<br>

			<br>
			<b>Multiple Asian Language use tips</b><br>
			When running an operating system that has support for multiple CJK locales, there may be problems when copying text from multi-lingual PDF files that contain Chinese characters (hanzi, kanji, or hanja). MacOS &quot;Language Kits&quot; and MacOS 8.5's &quot;Multilingual Internet Access&quot; allow the user to enable multiple CJK scripts. Microsoft's free &quot;Language Packs&quot; provide the same functionality for Windows.<br>
			<br>
			The problems arise because CIDs are mapped to Unicode values to derive content.<br>
			<br>
			Some Chinese characters that are unique to a single language (or locale). For example, Unicode value U+4E6B exists only in Korean (KS X 1001:1992 Row-Cell 42-65). Such characters are handled without problem by Acrobat since there is no ambiguity.<br>
			<br>However, some Chinese characters are common across the CJK languages, and there is ambiguity in deciding what language should be chosen. For example, the Unicode value. U+4E00 maps to Simplified Chinese (GB 2312-80 Row-Cell 50-27), Traditional Chinese (Big Five 0xA440), Japanese (JIS X 0208:1997 Row-Cell 16-76), and Korean (KS X 1001:1992 Row-Cell 76-73). There are over 2,500 Chinese characters that fall into this category. In such cases, Acrobat may fail to correctly identify the script (language), which causes a mismatch between the reported script and the actual encoding of the characters that are copied then pasted into other applications.<br>
			<br>
			For example, paste such a common character into an Acrobat Note and then press ctrl-click to see what language is selected. Pasting the same character into another application may not reflect the encoding that is reflected by the checked script.<br>
			<br>
			The work-around is to paste characters into an Acrobat Note, explicitly select (or re-select to ensure that the encoding is correct) the script, then re-copy the text. The text can now be pasted into other applications with more predictable results.[294351]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Notes - Changing Language of Notes can cause data loss</b><br>
			When you right-click on a Note a pop-up menu appears with a check next to the language that the note is written in. If you change this between Asian languages, or between an Asian language and Roman language, text in the Note may be changed or lost.[287913]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK PostScript Printing - Expected fonts on printer</b><br>
			When printing to a Chinese or Korean--enabled PostScript printer Acrobat expects certain fonts to be installed on the printer. If the font that is used in the document is present on the printer, it will be used; if not then the following default substitute fonts will be used, and are assumed to be on the printer.<br>
			<br>
			Korean: /Serif /HYSMyeongJo-Medium<br>
			/SansSerif /HYGoThic-Medium<br>
			<br>
			ChineseSimplified: /Serif /STSong-Light<br>
			/SansSerif /STHeiti-Regular<br>
			<br>
			ChineseTraditional: /Serif /MKai-Medium<br>
			/SansSerif /MHei-Medium<br>
			<br>
			If this is not satisfactory, please check the &quot;Download Asian Fonts&quot; option in the print dialog box and the fonts available on your workstation will be used for printing.[289269]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Printing Tilemarks</b><br>
			The title, date, and time are not emitted in tiling slugs if any of them use Unicode characters. Only the page number and the tile numbers are emitted.[416228]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Switching to an English User Interface turns off some CJK specific functionality</b><br>
			Switching the User Interface to &quot;English&quot;(in General Preferences) the following problem with functions that rely on CJK language resources:<br>
			<br>
			1. The Find Dialog will not display the option: &quot;Half/Full width Kana&quot;.[289075]<br>
			<br>
			<b>Most CJK fonts are substituted with Serif-style fonts</b><br>
			If a CJK font referenced in a PDF file is not on the displaying system and the font is not embedded in the PDF file, and the Serif flag is not set in the PDF file, then the font will be substituted for with a Serif style substitute font. Unfortunately, the Distiller in Acrobat 4.0 does not set the Serif flag, so most CJK fonts will be substituted with a serif font. If you would like to maintain the look and feel of your fonts, please embed them in the PDF.[293533]<br>
			<br>
			<b>TrueType fonts embedded in PDF files may display poorly when strokes overlap</b><br>
			If TrueType fonts are downloaded by the PostScript driver as Type 1 rather than Type 42, and strokes of the font overlap, then the intersection of the strokes will display as white rather than the black that is expected. Normally CJk fonts will be downloaded as Type 42, and if downloaded as Type 1 this may indicate a problem in the font. Also, be sure you are using the latest AdobePS 4 driver.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Japanese Full and Half-width Kana Find</b><br>
			In the Japanese Find dialog box, when the option to distinguish between half and full-width kana is NOT checked, Acrobat will Find all the half- and full-width, Katakana and Hiragana, Vertical and Horizontal variants of the entered kana. With the box checked, only the exact entered kana character will be found.[289073]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Forms<br>
			</b>On a system which does not have Asian Language Support installed, if you open a CJK Forms PDF which contains differently encoded CJK characters than those the Form was created with, the CJK Form fields will not be displayed correctly. Most Form fields will not appear at all. To prevent this, be sure to install Asian Language Support on systems that will be viewing and using CJK Forms. See this ReadMe's section titled &quot;Installing Asian Language Files for Acrobat 5.x or Acrobat Reader 5.x&quot; above for additional information. [412829]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Text Display in Acrobat Dialogs<br>
			</b>On a Roman system, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese (CJK) text cannot be displayed in Acrobat dialogs. Acrobat requires a CJK system with the appropriate CJK system font in order to display CJK characters in its dialogs.[395326]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Text Display when Overprint Preview is on</b><br>
			When a PDF containing CJK characters that have a relatively complicated glyph design, is viewed with Overprint Preview turned on, the text may look less clear than when Overprint Preview is turned off.[416395]<br>
			<br>
			<b>CJK Text Display of bolded text when magnification is applied</b>
			<br>Some CJK bolded characters may be blurred if the original application created the bolded text with synthetic bolding. If the Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel are turned off, when the document is magnified you may see some white areas or cracks. Acrobat 4.x writes a character four times to achieve bolding, and for some documents, such text may appear as four lines of text instead of appearing as bold text. In Acrobat 5.x, synthetic bolding is used. Adobe recommends turning on the Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel to avoid seeing white areas or cracks when the bolded text is magnified. [418447]			<br>
